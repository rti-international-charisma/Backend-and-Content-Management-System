Each module also controls its own [Navigation Bar](/concepts/application/#_2-navigation-bar), so they can provide tailored access to their sub-pages. All core functionality within the App can be bucketed into one of the following core modules:\n\n- [Collections](/concepts/application/#collections-module) — The primary way to view and interact with database content\n- [User Directory](/concepts/application/#user-directory) — A dedicated section for the platform's system Users\n- [File Library](/concepts/application/#file-library) — An aggregate of all files uploaded and managed within the platform\n- [Documentation](/concepts/application/#documentation) — A tailored, in-app portal for the platform's concepts, guides, and reference\n- [Settings](/concepts/application/#settings) — An Admin-Only section for configuring the project and system settings\n\n## Custom Module Extensions\n\nIn addition to these core modules, custom modules offer a _blank canvas_ for creating altogether new/different experiences within the App, such as proprietary dashboards, compound datasets, or third-party integrations (eg: a Stripe Payments Console).\n\n#### Relevant Guides\n\n- [Creating a Custom Module](/guides/modules)\n"}}]);
