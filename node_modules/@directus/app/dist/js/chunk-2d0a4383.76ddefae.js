This approach has many unique advantages:\n\n- A custom (pure) SQL database schema, tailored to your exact requirements\n- Significant performance improvements through optimizations and indexing\n- Complete transparency, portability, and security for your data\n- Direct database access and the full power of raw/complex SQL queries\n- Allows importing existing databases, unaltered and without any migrations\n\n## Dynamic API\n\nThe Directus API uses _Database Mirroring_ to dynamically generate REST endpoints and a GraphQL schema based on the\nconnected database's architecture. It is written in [Node.js](https://nodejs.dev) and uses database abstraction to\nsupport most [SQL database vendors](/guides/installation/cli/#_1-confirm-minimum-requirements).\n\n#### Relevant Docs\n\n- [API Reference](/reference/api/introduction/)\n- [API Extensions](/concepts/extensions/#api-extensions)\n\n## Database Abstraction\n\nDirectus supports mirroring all the most SQL databases. There are many different SQL database vendors, including popular choices such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite. Each vendor has subtle (and sometimes not so subtle) differences in how they function, so Directus includes an abstraction layer that helps it avoid writing different code for each different type.\n\nThis means there is the possiblility of supporting other datastores in the future, such as NoSQL options like MongoDB, or even third-party data services like Firebase or Heroku. However these options are _fundamentally_ different from the relational SQL databases we currently support, and so more research is needed.\n"}}]);
