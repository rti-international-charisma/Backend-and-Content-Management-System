Each collection represents a **table** in your database.\n\nDirectus automatically uses a built-in title formatter to display your database table names prettified, however you can use [schema translations](/concepts/translations/#schema-translations) to completely rename them if needed.\n\nCollections can be organized in any way that is appropriate for your project. You can architect them platform-specific\n(eg: _pages_ of a website), or in a more platform-agnostic way (eg: raw _customers_ of your business). While there's no\nright or wrong way to structure your data-model, we recommend keeping your data as agnostic as possible so it is easier\nto repurpose in the future. **In short, learn to see your data as its own asset — not only through the lens of your\nimmediate project needs**.\n\nThe only requirement of a collection is that it must contain a **Primary Key** field. This field stores a unique value that is used to reference the Collection's items throughout the database/platform.\n\n#### Relevant Guides\n\n- [Creating a Collection](/guides/collections/#creating-a-collection)\n- [Configuring a Collection](/guides/collections/#configuring-a-collection)\n- [Deleting a Collection](/guides/collections/#deleting-a-collection)\n- [Adjusting a Collection Layout](/guides/collections/#adjusting-a-collection-layout)\n\n## Collection Presets & Bookmarks\n\nPresets store the exact state of a [collection detail](/concepts/application/#collection-detail) page. They are used to set layout defaults for a user, or to define bookmarks that can be used to quickly recall specific datasets. Each preset stores the following information:\n\n- **Collection** — The collection of the preset\n- **Layout** — The Layout the preset applies to\n- **Layout Query** — Order direction, order field, pagination, etc\n- **Layout Options** — The configuration of all layout options\n- **Search** — Any fulltext search query applied\n- **Filters** — Any advanced fitlers applied\n- **User** — Optional; scopes to a specific user\n- **Role** — Optional; scopes to a specific role\n- **Bookmark Name** — Optional; determines if the preset is a bookmark\n\n#### Relevant Guides\n\n- [Creating a Preset](/guides/presets/#creating-a-preset)\n- [Deleting a Preset](/guides/presets/#deleting-a-preset)\n"}}]);
