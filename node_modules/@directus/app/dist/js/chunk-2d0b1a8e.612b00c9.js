It has the same functionality as the REST API, and can be accessed through `/graphql`.\n\n::: warning Mutations\n\nThe Directus GraphQL endpoint does not yet support mutations.\n\n:::\n\n[[toc]]\n\n## GraphiQL\n\nBy default, Directus will render GraphiQL when opening the `/graphql` endpoint in the browser. This\'ll allow you to\nexperiment with GraphQL, and explore the data within.\n\nLike, where to post, where to enter the token, some basic queries, disclaimer that there are no mutations yet, how to do\nsystem tables vs custom tables, etc\n\n## Authentication\n\nBy default, the GraphQL endpoint will access data as the public role. If you feel like collections or fields are\nmissing, make sure you\'re authenticated as a user that has access to those fields. See\n[Authentication](/reference/api/authentication).\n\n## Querying Data\n\nAll data in the user-created collections can be accessed through the root `items` property:\n\n```graphql\nquery {\n\titems {\n\t\tarticles {\n\t\t\tid\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nAll system data can be accessed through the root as well, by using the system collection name without the `directus_`\nprefix:\n\n```graphql\nquery {\n\tfiles {\n\t\tid\n\t}\n\n\tusers {\n\t\tid\n\t}\n\n\t// etc\n}\n```\n\n## Query Parameters\n\nAll [global query parameters](/reference/api/query/) are available as Arguments in GraphQL, for example:\n\n```graphql\nquery {\n\titems {\n\t\tarticles(sort: "published_on", limit: 15, filter: { status: { _eq: "published" } }) {\n\t\t\tid\n\t\t\ttitle\n\t\t\tbody\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n## Many-to-Any / Union Types\n\nMany-to-Any fields can be queried using GraphQL Union Types:\n\n```graphql\nquery {\n\titems {\n\t\tpages {\n\t\t\tsections {\n\t\t\t\titem {\n\t\t\t\t\t__typename\n\n\t\t\t\t\t... on headings {\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttitle\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlevel\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\t\t... on paragraphs {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbody\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\t\t... on videos {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsource\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n'}}]);
