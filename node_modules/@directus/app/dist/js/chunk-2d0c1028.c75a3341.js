You can choose between local,\n> self-hosted on-premises, or our managed Cloud solution.\n\nWhile our CLI is the recommended method for self-hosting, you can use whichever of these self-hosted options best suits\nyour needs. These methods offer a high level of customization and are ideal for intermediate developers.\n\n- [Command Line Interface (CLI)](/guides/installation/cli)\n- [Docker](/guides/installation/docker)\n- [Manually](/guides/installation/manual)\n\n::: tip Development Environment\n\nTo work on the Directus Core source code, please follow our [Contributing Guide](/contributing/introduction).\n\n:::\n\n## Deployment Guides\n\nThe following guides will walk you through the self-hosted installation process for specific third-party platforms.\nThese options are only recommended for developers familiar with these services and comfortable with more advanced setup.\nWhile Directus is always completely free, you will likely need to pay for these services.\n\n- [Generic Ubuntu](/guides/installation/ubuntu)\n- [Amazon AWS](/guides/installation/aws)\n- [DigitalOcean App Platform](/guides/installation/digitalocean-app-platform)\n\n## One-Click Installs\n\nIf you would like to completely avoid the manual installation process, the following self-hosted one-click apps will\nhandle the heavy-lifting for you. While Directus is always completely free, you will likely need to pay for these\nservices.\n\n- [Directus DigitalOcean App](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/directus?action=deploy&refcode=4c0b6062c16e)\n- [Directus Platform.sh App](https://console.platform.sh/projects/create-project?template=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fplatformsh%2Ftemplate-builder%2Fmaster%2Ftemplates%2Fdirectus%2F.platform.template.yaml)\n- [Heroku App](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/directus-community/heroku-template)\n\n## Directus Cloud\n\nIn addition to the self-hosted options above, you can also choose to create Directus projects using our official Managed\nCloud Service. This is the easiest way to get up-and-running with Directus â€” even for non-technical users.
