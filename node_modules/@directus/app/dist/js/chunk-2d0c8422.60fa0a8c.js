Each project represents a **Database**, but also encapsulates a config file, asset storage, and any custom extensions.\n\nProjects are the highest level of structure in Directus. While there are many customizable facets to a Project, you can essentially think of them as individual [Databases](concepts/databases/).\n\n#### Relevant Guides\n\n- [Creating a Project](/guides/projects/#creating-a-project)\n- [Configuring a Project](/guides/projects/#configuring-a-project)\n- [Adjusting Project Settings](/guides/projects/#adjusting-project-settings)\n- [Upgrading a Project](/guides/projects/#upgrading-a-project)\n- [Backing-up a Project](/guides/projects/#backing-up-a-project)\n- [Migrating a Project](/guides/projects/#migrating-a-project)\n- [Deleting a Project](/guides/projects/#configuring-a-project)\n\n## Environments\n\nThis compartmentalized approach means you can also create different Environments (eg: Dev, Staging, Prod) simply by creating additional Project instances. In short, there is no difference between a Project and an Environment.\n\n#### Relevant Guides\n\n- [Migrating a Project](/guides/projects/#migrating-a-project)\n\n## Multitenancy\n\nPrevious versions of Directus allowed managing multiple databases within a single installation. However this because overly complex in the scoping of routes, API endpoints, and custom code. In Directus 9+, to create multitenancy you have several options:\n\n- **Project Scoping** — Creating a super-admin layer that provisions new tenant projects has been made easier by the Cloud-native model of Directus 9+. This method involves developing custom code that can dynamically spin up/down projects, but is also the most flexible, supporting scoped extensions and differentiated project settings.\n- **Role Scoping** — In this method, you create one Role per tenant, and configure their permissions to properly scope them within a single project. This direction allows for tenants to share a single schema using _item_ scoped permissions, or different schemas by using _collection_ scoped permissions.\n"}}]);
