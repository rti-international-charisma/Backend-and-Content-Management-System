If you are looking for the previous **[Directus 8](https://github.com/directus/v8-archive/releases/latest)**\n(PHP) docs, you can find them [here](https://v8.docs.directus.io).\n\n:::\n\n## What is Directus?\n\n**Directus is an Open Data Platform for managing the content of any SQL database. It provides a powerful API layer for\ndevelopers and an intuitive App for non-technical users.** Written entirely in JavaScript (primarily\n[Node.js](https://nodejs.dev) and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org)), Directus is completely open-source, modular, and\nextensible, allowing it to be fully tailored to your exact project needs.\n\nOur platform can be used as a headless CMS for managing digital experiences, a database client for democratizing data,\nor as a standalone back-office web app for CRM, inventory, business intelligence, project management, etc.\n\n::: tip What's in a name?\n\n\"Directus\" ([duh REKT iss](http://audio.pronouncekiwi.com/Salli/Directus)) is Latin for: _laid straight, arranged in\nlines_. The broadest goal of our platform is to present data in a simple, orderly, and intuitive way.\n\n:::\n\n## What makes it unique?\n\n**Directus dynamically generates custom API endpoints based on your SQL database's schema in real-time — something we\ncall \"Database Mirroring\".** Whether you install fresh or on top of an existing database, you always maintain end-to-end\ncontrol over your actual database, including: tables, columns, datatypes, default values, indexes, relationships, etc.\n\nPerhaps one of the biggest advantages of _Database Mirroring_ is that you have direct access to your pure and unaltered\ndata. That means you have the option to bypass the Directus middleware (API, SDK, App) and connect to your data with\nproper SQL queries. This effectively removes all bottlenecks, latency overhead, and proprietary access limitations.\n\nDirectus is a simple solution for complex problems, with a data-first approach guided by the following core principles:\n\n- **Pure** — There is no predefined model or proprietary rules for your schema, and all system settings are stored\n  separately.\n- **Open** — Our entire codebase is public and transparent, allowing for end-to-end audits. Nothing is obfuscated or\n  black-boxed.\n- **Portable** — Data is stored in your bespoke database and can be migrated/exported/backed-up at any time. Absolutely\n  no vendor lock-in.\n- **Limitless** — Create unlimited users, roles, languages, collections, and items. No arbitrary restrictions or paywall\n  limitations.\n- **Extensible** — Every aspect of the platform is modular, allowing you to adapt, customize, and infinitely extend the\n  Core engine.\n- **Unopinionated** — Choose your database (all SQL vendors), API (REST or GraphQL), and infra (self-hosted or Cloud).\n\n## The Directus Ecosystem\n\n### Open-Source Core\n\nOur completely free and open-source (GPLv3) Open Data Platform.
