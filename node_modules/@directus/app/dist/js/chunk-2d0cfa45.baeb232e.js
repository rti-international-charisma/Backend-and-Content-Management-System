[Learn more about Projects](/concepts/projects/).\n\n## Creating a Project\n\nTo install Directus, choose one of the following methods.\n\n- [Command Line Interface (CLI)](/guides/installation/cli)\n- [Docker](/guides/installation/docker)\n- [Manually](/guides/installation/manual)\n\n## Configuring a Project\n\nAll project configuration is handled by the `.env` file within the `/api` directory. This file accepts a number of\nenvironment variables, each is explained in the following reference:\n\n- [Environment Variables](/reference/environment-variables)\n\n## Adjusting Project Settings\n\n1. Navigate to **Settings > Project Settings**\n2. Configure any of the following **branding fields**\n\n- **Project Name** — The name used at the top of the [Navigation Bar](/concepts/application/#_2-navigation-bar) and on\n  the login/public pages\n- **Project URL** — The URL when clicking the logo at the top of the [Module Bar](/concepts/application/#_1-module-bar)\n- **Project Color** — The color used behind the logo at the top of the\n  [Module Bar](/concepts/application/#_1-module-bar), on the login/public pages, and for the browser's FavIcon\n- **Project Logo** — A 40x40 pixel logo at the top of the [Module Bar](/concepts/application/#_1-module-bar) and on the\n  login/public pages. The image is _inset_ within the 64x64 pixel square filled with the Project Color, so we recommend\n  using a SVG or PNG logo with transparency to avoid a \"boxy\" look.\n\n::: tip Browser FavIcon & Title\n\nThe Project Color is also used to set a dynamic favicon, and the Project Name is used in the browser's page\ntitle. This makes it easier to identify different Directus projects in the browser.\n\n:::\n\n### Public Pages\n\nIn addition to the above global Project Settings, you can also apply the following styling to tailor your project's\n[public pages](/guides/projects/#public-pages).\n\n- **Public Foreground** — An image centered in the public page's right-pane. Limited to a maximum width of 400px.\n- **Public Background** — An image displayed behind the above foreground image, shown full-bleed within the public\n  page's right-pane. When a Public Background image is not set, the Project Color is used instead.\n- **Public Note** — A helpful note displayed at the bottom of the public page's right-pane; supports markdown for\n  rich-text formatting\n\n### Security\n\n- **Auth Password Policy** — Allows setting a policy requirement for all user's passwords, with the following options:\n  - None — Not recommended\n  - Weak — Minimum of 8 characters\n  - Strong — Uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters\n- **Auth Login Attempts** — Sets the number of failed login attempts allowed before a user's account is locked. Once\n  locked, an Admin user is required to unlock the account.\n\n### Files & Thumbnails\n\nSee [Creating a Thumbnail Preset](/guides/files/#creating-a-thumbnail-preset)\n\n### App Overrides\n\nSee [Styles > Custom CSS](/guides/styles/#custom-css)\n\n## Upgrading a Project\n\n1. Backup your project\n2. Run `npm update`\n3. Run `npx directus database migrate:latest` to update the DB\n\n## Backing-up a Project\n\n1. Make a copy of the **files within each storage adapter**, and store them in a safe place\n2. Make a copy of the **Env file** (`/api/.env`), and store it in a safe place\n3. Run the **Backup API Endpoint** (`/backup`) to create a SQL dump of your database\n\n## Migrating a Project\n\nDirectus doesn't rely on anything besides the database for it's operation. Therefore, migrating your Directus project\ncan be done by moving the whole database to a new location using a database dump.\n\n::: tip File Storage\n\nIf you have files uploaded, make sure to copy those over as well, or use the same storage location in the new location\nof Directus.\n\n:::\n\n## Deleting a Project\n\n1. Optional: **Backup any local files** stored within the project's root directory\n2. Optional: **Backup any custom code and extensions** within the project's root directory\n3. Optional: **Backup your entire database**, only system tables, or only project tables\n4. **Delete the project's root directory** from the server\n5. **Delete all Directus system tables** (`directus_*`) from the database\n\n::: tip Pure SQL\n\nAfter completing this process, you will be left with a pure SQL database, with no trace that Directus was ever\ninstalled. Any external services connecting to your database's project tables directly (eg: SQL queries) should continue\nworking normally.\n\n:::\n"}}]);
