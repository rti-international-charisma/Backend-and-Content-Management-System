Makes sure the instances stay alive, and will\nreplace individual instances in case of unexpected crashes.\n\nWe recommend setting up a repo in GitHub (or another Git provider) and configuring it using\n[our manual installation flow](/guides/installation/manual/#installing-manually). This allows you to later hook up the repo to your Elastic\nBeanstalk instance through CodeDeploy.\n\nSee\n[Deploying Node.js applications to Elastic Beanstalk](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/create_deploy_nodejs.html)\nfor more information.\n\nDirectus' configuration is all set through environment variables. For a full overview of all available environment\nvariables, see [Environment Variables](/reference/environment-variables)\n\n## CodeDeploy\n\nAllows you to automatically deploy updates to your Directus instance or extensions to Elastic Beanstalk.\n\nSee\n[Automatically Deploy from GitHub Using AWS CodeDeploy](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/automatically-deploy-from-github-using-aws-codedeploy/)\nfor more information.\n\n## Simple Storage Service (S3)\n\nIdeal place to store files uploaded to Directus. Your bucket doesn't have to be publicly accessible to the web; Directus\nwill stream files from and to the bucket in its /asset endpoint.\n\nSee [Creating a bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/CreatingABucket.html) for more information.\n\n## Relational Database Service (RDS) (Aurora)\n\nWhile you can technically use any of the SQL based databases offered in AWS, we like to use Aurora. It's auto-scaling\nand use-based costs have worked out pretty well for us in the past.\n\n## CloudFront\n\nWhile it's not a technical requirement, it's not a bad idea to configure a CloudFront instance in front of your EB\nenvironment. This protects you from DDoS attacks and allows you to cache repeated calls to assets in its CDN.\n\nSee\n[Using Elastic Beanstalk with Amazon CloudFront](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/AWSHowTo.cloudfront.html)\nfor more information.\n\n## Route 53\n\nThe last piece of this puzzle is to assign a domain name to your CloudFront instance. You can use Route 53 for this\npurpose.\n\nSee\n[Routing traffic to an Amazon CloudFront web distribution by using your domain name](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-to-cloudfront-distribution.html)\nfor more information.\n"}}]);
