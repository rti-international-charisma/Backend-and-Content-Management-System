Keeping Directus completely free and open-source is our way of saying: **Thank you!**\n\n::: tip We're here to help!\n\nIf you have _any_ questions along your contributor journey, please feel free to come chat with us on our [Discord Community](https://directus.chat).\n\n:::\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\n**The Directus [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/directus/directus/blob/main/code_of_conduct.md) is one of the ways we put our values into practice. We expect all of our staff, contractors and contributors to know and follow this code.**\n\n**Our contributors and maintainers work extremely hard to build Directus as premium open-source software. Please be respectful of those efforts throughout our ecosystem. Trolling, harassing, insulting, or other unacceptable behavior by participants will not be tolerated.**\n\nIn the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body\nsize, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,\nlevel of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal\nappearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.\n\nExamples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment\ninclude:\n\n* Using welcoming and inclusive language\n* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences\n* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism\n* Focusing on what is best for the community\n* Showing empathy towards other community members\n\n**Before continuing, please take a moment to read our full [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/directus/directus/blob/main/contributing.md).**\n\n## Wait â€” Before you Begin\n\nWhen contributing to this repository, it is important to first discuss the change you wish to make with the owners of this repository. This can be done via [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/directus/directus/issues), [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/directus/directus/discussions), [Discord](https://directus.chat), [email](mailto:info@directus.io), or any other method.\n\nFollowing this rule will help avoid wasted time caused by multiple people working on the same issue or writing code that will not be merged.\n\n## Feature Requests\n\nFeature requests are a great way to let our team know what should be prioritized next. You can\n[submit a new feature request](https://github.com/directus/directus/discussions/category_choices) or\n[vote on existing submissions](https://github.com/directus/directus/discussions) via GitHub Discussions.\n\n::: warning The 80/20 Rule\n\nTo keep the Directus codebase as clean and simple as possible, we will only consider approving features that we feel at\nleast 80% of our user-base will find valuable. If your feature request falls within the 20% range, it is considered an\nedge-case and should be implemented as an extension.\n\n:::\n\n## RFCs\n\nSome Directus features/fixes may require additional design, strategy, and/or discussion before beginning work. For these\nnotable pull-requests, you should first submit an RFC (Request For Comments) to our core team via\n[Discord](https://directus.chat). This process is relatively informal, but ensures proper alignment, and helps avoid\nsquandered development time by contributors.\n\n## Bug Reporting\n\nReporting any bugs you come across is an invaluable part of helping keep Directus stable. After confirming a similar\nissue doesn't already exist, you can [submit a bug report](https://github.com/directus/directus/issues/new) via GitHub\nIssues. Please ensure the following for all submissions:\n\n- You are experiencing an actual bug, not a configuration issue\n- You are not asking a question or requesting a new feature\n- You have checked that no similar issue already exists\n- You have entered a clear and concise title\n- You have followed the issue template, with stack details and steps to reproduce\n- You have already tried the following troubleshooting steps:\n  - You are on the latest version of Directus\n  - You have stopped (`CTRL+C`) and restarted the server\n  - You have confirmed the issue is not related to your own custom code\n  - Dev Only: You have cleared and reinstalled all dependencies\n\n## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities\n\nIf you believe you have discovered a security issue within a Directus product or service, please reach out to us\ndirectly over email: [security@directus.io](mailto:security@directus.io). We will then open a\n[GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/directus/directus/security/advisories) for tracking the fix.\n\nWe value the members of the independent security research community who find security vulnerabilities and work with our\nteam so that proper fixes can be issued to users. Our policy is to credit all researchers in the fix's release notes. In\norder to receive credit, security researchers must follow responsible disclosure practices, including:\n\n- They do not publish the vulnerability prior to the Directus team releasing a fix for it\n- They do not divulge exact details of the issue, eg: through exploits or proof-of-concepts\n\n## Submitting a Pull-Request\n\n### 1. Submit an RFC (if needed)\n\nPlease read our docs on the [RFC process](#rfcs).\n\n### 2. Update relevant docs\n\nBefore submitting any pull-requests, ensure that any relevant documentation (included in this same repo) is updated.\n\n### 3. Push your changes\n\n```bash\ngit push -u origin YOUR-BRANCH-NAME\n```\n\n### Submit a pull-request\n\nOnce you push the changes to your repo, the \"Compare & pull request\" button will appear in GitHub. Click it and you'll\nbe taken to a screen where you can fill in the appropriate details. Finally, open the pull request by clicking the\n\"Create pull request\" button.\n\nNow our core staff will review your contribution and either merge it, or request that you to make changes.\n\n## Syncing Your Fork with Directus\n\nAfter you have submitted your pull requests, you would need to sync your fork with Directus to pull all the latest\ncommits before you continue to contribute.\n\n### 1. Add Directus as a Remote\n\nWhile your fork is your main remote or origin, you will add Directus as the upstream, which generally refers to the\noriginal repo that you have forked.\n\n```bash\ngit remote add upstream git@github.com:directus/directus.git\n```\n\n### 2. Fetch the Latest Changes\n\nDepending on your setup, you will need to get the latest commits from the `main` branch of Directus by doing a pull,\nreset, rebase or fetch.\n\n```bash\ngit pull upstream main\n```\n\nAt this point you are ready to continue working on Directus, with the latest commits included!\n\n::: tip\n\nBefore you begin or resume development, be sure to always sync, if you are going to submit a pull request with your\nchanges!\n\n:::\n"}}]);
