To install the _Production_ version locally, please follow to our [standard installation guides](/getting-started/installation/).\n\n::: tip Minimum Requirements\n\nYou will need to have [the latest version of Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/) to _build_ a Development version of Directus.\n\n:::\n\n## 1. Fork the Directus repository\n\nGo to the [repository](https://github.com/directus/directus) and fork it to your GitHub account. A fork is your copy of\nthe Directus repository. Forking the repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the\noriginal project.\n\n## 2. Clone from your repository\n\n```bash\ngit clone git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/directus.git\n```\n\n## 3. Make a new branch\n\n```bash\ngit checkout -b YOUR-BRANCH-NAME\n```\n\n## 4. Install the dependencies\n\n```bash\nnpm install\n```\n\n## 5. Setup the Database & Env File\n\nFor this step, you'll need to already have a SQL database up-and-running, otherwise you can only use the SQLite driver,\nwhich will create the database for you. Run the following command from within root of the project:\n\n```bash\nnpm run cli -- init\n```\n\n## 6. Start the development server\n\nRun the following command from the root directory.\n\n```bash\nnpm run dev\n```\n\nIf you are only looking to work on the Documentation (public website version), you can navigate to the `docs` directory and run the following command:\n\n```bash\nnpm run dev:site\n```\n\n::: tip\n\nIf you encounter errors during this installation process, make sure your node version meets the\n[minimum requirements](/guides/installation/cli)\n\n:::\n\n## 7. Make your fixes/changes\n\nAt this point you are ready to start working on Directus! Before diving in however, it's worth reading through our docs\non [submitting a pull-request](#Submitting-a-Pull-Request).\n"}}]);
