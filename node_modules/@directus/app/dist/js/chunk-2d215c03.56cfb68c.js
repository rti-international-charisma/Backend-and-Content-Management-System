All functionality can be accessed by running `npx directus <command>` in your project folder.\n\n[[toc]]\n\n## Initialize a New Project\n\n```\nnpx directus init\n```\n\nWill install the required database driver, and create a `.env` file based on the inputted values.\n\n## Bootstrap a Project\n\n```\nnpx directus bootstrap\n```\n\nWill use an existing `.env` file (or existing environment variables) to either install the database (if it's empty) or\nmigrate it to the latest version (if it already exists and has missing migrations).\n\nThis is very useful to use in environments where you're doing standalone automatic deployments, like a multi-container\nKubernetes configuration, or a similar approach on\n[DigitalOcean App Platform](/guides/installation/digitalocean-app-platform/) or\n[AWS Elastic Beanstalk](/guides/installation/aws/)\n\n::: tip First User\n\nYou can use the `ADMIN_EMAIL` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variables to automatically provision the first user on\nfirst creation using the `bootstrap` command. See [Environment Variables](/reference/environment-variables/) for more\ninformation.\n\n:::\n\n## Install the Database\n\n```\nnpx directus database install\n```\n\nInstalls the Directus system tables on an empty database. Used internally by `bootstrap`\n\n## Upgrade the Database\n\n```\nnpx directus database migrate:latest\nnpx directus database migrate:up\nnpx directus database migrate:down\n```\n\nMigrate the database up/down to match the versions of Directus. Once you update Directus itself, make sure to run\n`npx directus database migrate:latest` (or `npx directus bootstrap`) to update your database.\n"}}]);
