Each field represents a **column** in your database.\n\nFor example, an `articles` collection might have `title`, `body`, `author`, and `date_published` fields. Directus automatically uses a built-in title formatter to display your database column names prettified, and you can use [schema translations](/concepts/translations/#schema-translations) to completely rename them if needed.\n\nFields also mirror other characteristics from their associated column, including its `type`, `default`, `length`, `allow_null`, etc.\n\n::: tip Relational Fields\n\nFields that reference other items (in the same collection or different) are called [relational fields](/concepts/relationships/). Linking or\nconnecting data relationally is an immensely powerful feature of relational databases and SQL queries.\n\n:::\n\n::: tip Aliases\n\nNot all fields in Directus map directly to an actual database column within their table â€” these are called \"alias\" fields. For example, certain relational fields, like [One-to-Many (O2M)](/concepts/relationships/#one-to-many-o2m) and [Many-to-Many (M2M)](/concepts/relationships/#many-to-many-m2m), represent data that is stored in _other_ tables. Then there are [Presentation Fields](/guides/field-types/presentation-field/) that don't save data at all, such as dividers and action buttons.\n\n:::\n\n#### Relevant Guides\n\n- [Creating a Standard Field](/guides/field-types/standard-field)\n- [Creating a Presentation Field](/guides/field-types/presentation-field)\n- [Creating a Many-to-One Field](/guides/field-types/many-to-one-field)\n- [Creating a One-to-Many Field](/guides/field-types/one-to-many-field)\n- [Creating a Many-to-Many Field](/guides/field-types/many-to-many-field)\n- [Creating a Many-to-Any Field](/guides/field-types/many-to-any-field)\n- [Creating Translated Fields](/guides/field-types/translated-fields)\n- [Duplicating Fields](/guides/fields/#duplicating-a-field)\n- [Adjusting Field Layout](/guides/fields/#adjusting-field-layout)\n- [Deleting Fields](/guides/fields/#deleting-a-field)\n"}}]);
