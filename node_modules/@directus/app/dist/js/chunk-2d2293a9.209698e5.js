These alternate versions are tracked so that previous states can be recovered, or potential edits can be staged.\n\nEvery change made to items in Directus is stored as a complete versioned snapshot. The Revisions system is tightly coupled to the Activity Logs system, with each revision being linked to\nthe specific [Activity](/concepts/application/#activity-log) event which created it.\n\n## Revision Fields\n\n- **Data** — A full snapshot of the item _after_ the event\n- **Delta** — The specific field data changed by this event\n- **Parent** — If this revision was created via a nested relationship\n\n\x3c!-- @TODO ::: tip Customizing Version Data\nSince versions store a full data snapshot and delta, the\n`directus_revisions` collection can quickly grow quite large, increasing database size and\npotentially decreasing performance. To remedy this, Directus allows\n[configuring version scope](/concepts/app-overview) per collection to set the exact field data\nsaved.\n:::\n\n::: tip Creating Detached Versions\n\nYou can also create a new version for an item without saving the data to the parent item itself. This allows you to "stage" changes to an item that may already be live/published.\n\n:::\n\n--\x3e\n\n#### Relevant Guides\n\n- [Reverting an Item](/guides/items/#reverting-an-item)\n'}}]);
