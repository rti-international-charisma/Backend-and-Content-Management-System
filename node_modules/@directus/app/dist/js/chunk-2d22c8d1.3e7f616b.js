There are several layers to this access control, including:\n\n- **Collection** — The Collection scope of this permission\n- **Action** — Create, Read, Update, or Delete\n- **Item Permissions** — Filters actionable Items using [Filter Rules](/reference/filter-rules/)\n- **Field Permissions** — Toggles which fields can be accessed\n- **Validation** — Filters Item values using [Filter Rules](/reference/filter-rules/)\n- **Presets** — Controls the default values for the action\n- **Limit** — Sets a maximum number of items that are actionable\n\nThere are also other access control features that are tied directly to the Role. These include:\n\n- **IP Access** — Restricts user access based on IP Address\n- **App Access** — Restricts user access to the App\n- **Admin Access** — Enables Settings and unrestricted user access\n\n### Example\n\nYou could set the permissions such that a user can only **Update** (Action) the **Title, Body, Date Published, and Category** (Field Permissions) within **Articles** (Collection) that **they created and are still unpublished** (Item Permissions) **one item at a time** (Limit) if they are **currently at the NYC office** (IP Access). Additionally, the **default Category will be "Opinon"** (Preset), and the **Date Published must be in the future** (Validation).\n\nAnd this is actually just a _simple_ example. Permissions and Validation support a comprehensive list of [Filter Operators](/reference/filter-rules/#filter-operators), [Relational Filtering](/reference/filter-rules/#filter-relational), [Logical Operators](/reference/filter-rules/#logical-operators), and [Dynamic Variables](/reference/filter-rules/#dynamic-variables).\n\n\n#### Relevant Guides\n\n- [Configuring Role Permissions](/guides/permissions/#configuring-role-permissions)\n- [Configuring System Permissions](/guides/permissions/#configuring-system-permissions)\n'}}]);
