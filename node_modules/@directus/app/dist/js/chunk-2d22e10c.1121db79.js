Enter a relative (App) or absolute (external) **link** for the module\n7. Use the drag handles to **drag-and-drop** the modules into the desired order\n\nIf you are looking to replicate the default modules, paste the following configuration into the Module Navigation field\nusing the Raw Value field label option.\n\n```json\n[\n\t{\n\t\t"icon": "box",\n\t\t"name": "Collections",\n\t\t"link": "/collections"\n\t},\n\t{\n\t\t"icon": "people_alt",\n\t\t"name": "User Directory",\n\t\t"link": "/users"\n\t},\n\t{\n\t\t"icon": "folder",\n\t\t"name": "File Library",\n\t\t"link": "/files"\n\t},\n\t{\n\t\t"icon": "info",\n\t\t"name": "Documentation",\n\t\t"link": "/docs"\n\t}\n]\n```\n\n::: warning Settings Module\n\nThe settings module is not controlled by this configuration. It is always added to the end of the list for any user\'s\nwith Admin Access.\n\n:::\n\n::: tip Customizing Existing Modules\n\nYou can enter the link to an existing module to customize its name or icon. For example, you can use `/collections` to\noverride the Collections module.\n\n:::\n\n### Customizing the Collection Navigation\n\nThe collections in the [Navigation Bar](/concepts/application/#_2-navigation-bar) can be overridden with custom options per role. When\nthis setting is empty, all collections that the user has permission to see are shown alphabetically in a single,\nunlabeled group.\n\n1. Navigate to **Settings > Roles & Permissions > [Role Name]**\n2. Scroll to the **Collection Navigation** field\n3. Click the **Add New Group** button to add a Grouping\n4.

Click the red **Delete Role** action button in the header\n3. Confirm this decision by clicking **Delete** in the dialog\n\n::: warning Users in a Deleted Role\n\nIf you delete a role that still has users in it, those users will be given a `NULL` role, which denies their App access\nand limits them to the [Public Role](/concepts/roles/#public-role) permissions. They can then be reassigned to a new\nrole by an admin.\n\n:::\n\n::: warning Last Admin\n\nYou must maintain at least one role/user with Admin Access so that you can still properly manage the project.\n\n:::\n\n::: warning Public Role\n\nYou can not delete the Public role, as it is part of the core platform. To disable it completely, simply turn off all\nPublic access permissions.\n\n:::\n'}}]);
