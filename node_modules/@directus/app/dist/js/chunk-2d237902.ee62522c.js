Roles also include options for configuring platform access, Two-Factor Auth, Module Navigation, and Collection Navigation. You can create an unlimited number of roles, so organize your users in whatever way feels most appropriate.\n\nTwo default roles, _Public_ and _Administrators_, are available after installing a clean copy of Directus.\n\n#### Relevant Guides\n\n- [Creating a Role](/guides/roles/#creating-a-role)\n- [Configuring a Role](/guides/roles/#configuring-a-role)\n- [Configuring Role Permissions](/guides/permissions/#configuring-role-permissions)\n- [Configuring System Permissions](/guides/permissions/#configuring-system-permissions)\n- [Deleting a Role](/guides/roles/#deleting-a-role)\n\n### Public Role\n\nNot technically a role, "Public" can\'t be found in the `directus_roles` table. Instead, it represents the _lack_ of a role, providing a place to configure permissions for _unauthenticated_ users. This role can not be deleted.\n\n::: warning Private by Default\n\nAll of the data within Directus is private by default. Permissions within the public role can be added by administrators on a case-by-case basis.\n\n:::\n\n### Administrators Role\n\nDuring the installation process, Directus automatically creates an "Administrators" Role, which is used to provide the initial admin user with full platform access. However this is just a _normal_ role, and so it can still be updated, renamed, or even deleted. Keep in mind that your project must maintain at least one\nrole with Admin Access at all times.\n'}}]);
