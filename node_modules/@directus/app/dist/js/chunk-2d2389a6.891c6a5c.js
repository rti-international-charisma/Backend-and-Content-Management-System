This is the most hands-off approach to moving from a v8 to a v9\ninstance, and is the recommended way of migrating your v8 instance.\n\n::: tip\n\nThe script, and instructions on how to run it, can be found on the\\\n[`directus-community/migration-tool`](https://github.com/directus-community/migration-tool) repo.\n\n:::\n\nThis tool will copy over:\n\n- Schema (collections / fields)\n- Files (including file contents)\n- User data (eg all items in all collections)\n- Roles\n- Users\n\nDue to significant differences in data structure between versions, this tool will **NOT** copy over:\n\n- Interface/display configurations\n- Permissions\n- Activity / revisions\n\n## Manual Database Export/Import\n\n::: warning Automated\n\nWe highly recommend using the automated migration tool mentioned above. If that's not possible, you can perform the\nfollowing steps to migrate your v8 instance.\n\n:::\n\nDirectus v9 is a breaking change coming from v8 (hence the major version bump), so you won't be able to just use your\nexisting v8 database and run v9 on top of it. However, due to the database-mirroring approach of Directus, it's fairly\nstraightforward to migrate your content from v8 to v9.\n\n#### 1) Setup a Fresh v9 Instance\n\nBy installing Directus \"fresh\", you're ensured your system tables are up-to-date and ready to go.\n\n#### 2) Migrate your Data\n\nUsing a tool like [Sequel Pro](http://sequelpro.com) or [TablePlus](https://tableplus.com), export your v8 user-tables\nand import them into your v9 database.\n\nDirectus v9 will automatically recognize your tables, and you'll be ready to get started in v9.\n\n**Note:** If you have references to users and files, make sure to update them to the new UUID format.\n\n#### 3) Configure Directus\n\nOnce the tables are in, you can start configuring the details of the schema. This includes choosing the correct\ninterfaces, displays, and their options for your fields.\n\nThis would also be a good time to reconfigure your permissions, to ensure they are accurate.\n"}}]);
