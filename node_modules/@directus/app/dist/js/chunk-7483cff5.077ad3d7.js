Installation\n\nMake sure you have the latest LTS version or newer of [Node.js](https://nodejs.dev) installed, and have a running\ndatabase ready to connect to.\n\nRun the following command in your terminal and follow the prompts.\n\n```bash\nnpx create-directus-project example-project\n```\n\n![Successful installation](../assets/getting-started/quickstart/terminal-install.png)\n\nOnce the installation is complete, you can start Directus by navigating to your project folder (in this case\n`example-project`) and running:\n\n```\nnpx directus start\n```\n\n![Server started](../assets/getting-started/quickstart/terminal-start.png)\n\n## 2. Login to App\n\nWith the server running, you\'re now able to login to your new Directus project and start using it.\n\nOur start command stated that the server started at port `8055`, which means we can navigate to\n[http://localhost:8055](http://localhost:8055) to open Directus in the browser.\n\nLogin using the admin credentials you configured during the installation in Step 1.\n\n## 3. Create a Collection\n\nOnce logged in, you\'re greeted with the option to create your first Collection:\n\n![Directus Empty State](../assets/getting-started/quickstart/empty-state.png)\n\nFollow the prompts and create a Collection. For the sake of this demo, we\'ll be calling ours `articles`, but feel free\nto make it your own!\n\n::: tip More Info on Collections\n\nFor a more in-depth guide to setting up Collections, see [Collections](/guides/collections).\n\n:::\n\n## 4. Create a Field\n\nWith the Collection created, it\'s time to start adding some Fields. Click the **"Create Field"** button, and select\n"Standard Field":\n\n![Directus Add a Field](../assets/getting-started/quickstart/add-field.png)\n\nWe\'ll be calling our Field `title`. While Directus offers a range of powerful field customization options, we\'ll be\nsticking to the defaults for now. These defaults use the "String" datatype and "Text Input" interface\n\n::: tip More Info on Fields\n\nTo learn more about the different types of Fields, and all available options, see [Fields](/guides/fields).\n\n:::\n\n## 5. Create an Item\n\nNow that we have a Collection with a Field configured, it\'s time to start adding some content. Navigate to the\nCollections Module (top left), open your created Collection, and click the "+" button in the top-right to get started.\n\n![Directus Create Item](../assets/getting-started/quickstart/create-item.png)\n\nOnce you\'re happy with your creation, click the checkmark in the top-right to save your item to the database.\n\n::: tip More Info on Items\n\nTo learn more about the different types of Items, and all available options, see [Items](/guides/items).\n\n:::\n\n## 6. Set Role/Public Permissions\n\nBy default, all content entered into Directus is considered private. This means that no data will be returned by the\nAPI, unless requested by an authenticated user that has the correct permissions. In order to have the API return our\nitems, we\'ll have to setup some permissions. Navigate to **Settings Module > Roles & Permissions**.\n\nDirectus ships with a special **"Public"** role that controls what data is returned to non-authenticated users. Select\nthe public role, find your collection, and click the icon under the "eye" icon (read/view permission) to allow the\npublic role to read the items in your collection.\n\n![Directus Permissions](../assets/getting-started/quickstart/permissions.png)\n\n::: tip More Info on Roles & Permissions\n\nRoles & Permissions are extremely powerful and can get pretty in-depth. To learn all about the nuances in setting up\nroles & permissions, see [Roles](/guides/roles) & [Permissions](/guides/permissions).\n\n:::\n\n## 7. Connect to the API\n\nNow that your project has some content in it, it\'s time to start using this content externally. Data can be accessed in\na number of ways, including the REST API, GraphQL, the CLI, or even straight from the database. In this case, we\'ll use\n[the `/items/` REST API endpoint](/reference/api/rest/items) to retrieve the item we just created.\n\nUsing your browser, or an API tool like [Postman](http://postman.com) or [Paw](https://paw.cloud), open\n[http://localhost:8055/items/articles](http://localhost:8055/items/articles).\n\nAnd there it is! The Article Item you just created is being served in beautiful JSON, ready to be used anywhere and\neverywhere!\n\n```json\n{\n\t"data": [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t"id": 1,\n\t\t\t"title": "Hello World!"\n\t\t}\n\t]\n}\n```\n'}}]);
